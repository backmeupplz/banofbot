# [@banofbot](https://telegram.me/banofbot) and [@silent_banofbot](https://telegram.me/banofbot) code
This repository contains the code for the democracy bots I've built. Readme is still in work, any contributions are welcome.

# Installation and local launch
1. Clone this repo:
```
git clone --single-branch ssh://git@github.com:443/<your_username>/banofbot.git
git config --local user.email <your_id>+<your_username>@users.noreply.github.com
```
2. Launch the [mongo database](https://www.mongodb.com/) locally
3. Create `.env` file with `TELEGRAM_API_KEY` and `MONGO_DB_URL`
4. Run `npm i` in the root folder
5. Run `npm run start`

And you should be good to go! Feel free to fork and submit pull requests. Thanks!
